    "text": "I am Jack Chen, a freshman who contacted a year of programming, and also a video creator.（Believe me, the two are somehow related） \nNow I working in the team of a Harvard postdoc. I have been exposed to many technology stacks, including R, Python, SQL, and container technologies for docker, Tableau and PowerBI for business intelligence visualization and so on. I’ve also been working to promote these tool technologies to more people, and I believe that the process of sharing makes me more proficient with these technologies. That’s why I became a bilibili video creator.\nThanks to this identity, I started to accumulate my own fans, so I organized a community, which allowed me to meet more people who are specialized in big data or interested in it. From time to time, I also invite bigwigs in the industry to share their experiences with us. I think these are very meaningful things, both to make more people like programming, and to spur myself to work harder!"
